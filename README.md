# Final-Project-Group3
The essence of this private repository is to execute the final project for group 3, where John M. Musah and Alan R. Galloway were assigned accordingly. We will have series of meetings in an attempt to finish this project and communicate our final output in a single html file on canvas for evaluation. In our package we include 6 functions to meet the requirements of the project. 

The 6 functions are as follows:
Coeff_beta(Dependent, Independent); This calculates our bhat value.

Coeff_ci(Dependent, Independent, Alpha = .05); This calculates our confidence interval.

Coeff_rsquared(Dependent, Independent); This calculates our R Squared value.

Coeff_Mallows_Cp(Dependent, Independent); This calculates our Mallows' Cp value.

Coeff_ftest(Dependent, Independent); This calculates our F-Statistic, Degrees of Freedom,  DFE, and our P-value for P(F > F*)

Coeff_plot(Dependent, Independent); This Calculates our Residuals vs Fitted-values, qq-plot of residuals, and our histogram of residuals.

In addition, we created Help documentation for all of these functions avialable with the ?function_name.
